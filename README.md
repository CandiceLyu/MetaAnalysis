# Meta-Analysis of Multiple Outcomes Using COVID-19 Vaccine Data

This repository contains the R and BUGS code used in the study, along with the datasets.

The research investigates the application of Bayesian multi-state modelling for synthesising multiple outcomes, particularly when these outcomes have structural dependencies. In addition, separate frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses were performed for each outcome individually. 

The materials provided here support the findings and conclusions of the dissertation.
