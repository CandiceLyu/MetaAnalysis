# Meta-Analysis of Multiple Outcomes Using COVID-19 Vaccine Data

## Overview

This repository contains essential files and scripts for the dissertation research on synthesising multiple outcomes using Bayesian multi-state modelling with COVID-19 vaccine data. The content is organised to support the findings and conclusions presented in the dissertation.

## Purpose

The contents in this repository are designed to provide a comprehensive view of the analyses conducted, including both the R and BUGS code, as well as the datasets used. They detail the methodologies and results of the research, showcasing the use of Bayesian techniques for multiple-outcome synthesis.

## Contents

1. **`R_running_scripts`**: R scripts for data processing, analyses, and visualisations.
2. **`docs`**: Documentations related to the study, including outputs from separate frequentist and Bayesian analyses.
3. **`multi_state_BUGS_code`**: BUGS code used for Bayesian multi-state modelling.
4. **`raw_data`**: Raw datasets used in the analyses.

## How to Use

1. **`R_running_scripts`**: Run these scripts in R to reproduce the data processing and analysis steps described in the dissertation.
2. **`docs`**: Review these documents for detailed insights into the study's methodologies and findings.
3. **`multi_state_BUGS_code`**: Run the BUGS code in appropriate Bayesian analysis software to replicate the multi-state modelling.
4. **`raw_data`**: Access these datasets for further analyses or to verify the results presented in the dissertation.
