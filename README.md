# Meta-Analysis with Multiple Outcomes using COVID-19 Vaccine Data

This repository contains all the R and BUGS codes, as well as the datasets used in the study. This study explores the value of Bayesian multi-state modeling in the synthesis of multiple outcomes, particularly when these outcomes exhibit structural dependencies. The resources provided here support the findings and analyses presented in the dissertation.

## Repository Structure

- **/raw_data**
  - Contains the raw and processed datasets utilised in the study.
  
- **/multi_state_BUGS_code**
  - Includes BUGS code for Bayesian multi-state modelling, covering both base-case and node-splitting models.

- **/R_running_scripts**
  - Contains R scripts for executing base-case and node-splitting BUGS models. Also includes scripts for prior and posterior predictive checks for separate Bayesian models, comparative forest plots between separate analyses and the multi-state model, and forest plots for individual models.

- **/docs**
  - Features output files and figures generated from the analyses.
